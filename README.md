# CRUD-App

Personal Project

## Description

I have developed a web application in which I implemented all CRUD functions (Create/Read/Update/Delete), using PHP and MySQL on the back-end. It illustrates a form for adding a person's information (first name and last name) and the application is storing them in a MySQL database, displaying all database entries on the screen with the possibility to 'Edit' (Update) or 'Delete' the entry from the database. I have used AJAX/jQuery so that the page will not reload after an operation. On the front-end UI, I have used Bootstrap to implement the mobile-first design pattern. The live version of the application where I also push updates is hosted on Heroku:
